    In the Python for Data Science workshop series you will be learning Python through the online learning platform **Dataquest**. 
    
    You will have **complete flexibility** to choose courses from Dataquest based on your personal learning goals and switch between 
    online self-study and supported in-person learning on-campus depending on your learning preferences and changing schedule.

    Each workshop is **one-hour** long, and you will work **with fellow learners**, utilising your **prior experience**, **web searches**, 
    and in-application Help features to find the solutions to real-world problems, with a **Python expert** on hand if you get stuck.

    ### What to do when you get stuck:
    - Ask your fellow students
    - Search online (here are a couple of useful resources):
        - The answer box on the top of Google's results page
        - [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) (for task specific solutions)
        - [RealPython](https://realpython.com) (for topic based tutorials)
        - [w3schools](https://w3schools.com]) (for short task specific tutorials and examples)
    - Ask one of our Python experts for help
