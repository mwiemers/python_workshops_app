    In the Python for Data Science workshop series you will be learning Python through the online learning platform **Dataquest**. 

    ### Why do we choose this format?

    By learning Python with Dataquest, you as the learner can:
    
    - choose freely what to learn
    - progress much further as when using in-house developed materials
    - switch between independent online and guided in-person learning depending on your schedule, availability and personal preference
    - work on a collection of projects provided on Dataquest to further consolidate and deepen your learning which is a great way to demonstrate your Python skills to employers
    - download certificates from dataquest and append these to your social media profiles (LinkedIN) to provide evidence of your learning
    
    Each workshop is **two-hours** long, and you will work **with fellow learners**, utilising your **prior experience**, **web searches**, 
    and in-application Help features to find the solutions to real-world problems, with a **Python expert** on hand if you get stuck.

    ### What to do when you get stuck:

    On Dataquest you have the option to see the solution for each exercise. We highly recommend to only use that as a last resort when you 
    have explored all other options. Being able to search effectively online, identify relevant resources and use them to fix your code 
    are very important skills to enable you to continue to learn independently.

    If you get stuck, we recommend to:

    - Ask one of our Python experts for help
    - Search online (here are a couple of useful resources):
        - The answer box on the top of Google's results page
        - [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) (for task specific solutions)
        - [RealPython](https://realpython.com) (for topic based tutorials)
        - [w3schools](https://w3schools.com]) (for short task specific tutorials and examples)
    - Ask your fellow students
