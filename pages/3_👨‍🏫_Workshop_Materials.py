    ## DSL Python workshops

    The Python Fundamentals workshops are open-format, which means that you can choose which topic to work on. It is advised to work through the materials 
    in order unless you are already familiar with a particular topic.

    Each workshop is **two-hours** long, and you will work **with fellow learners**, utilising your **prior experience**, **web searches**, 
    and in-application Help features to find the solutions to real-world problems, with a **Python expert** on hand if you get stuck.

    ### Python Fundamentals
    The Python Introduction workshops are for beginners that have no prior experience in programming with Python and cover the following topics:
    Python Fundamentals:
    - Numerical variables
    - String variables
    - Type casting
    - Lists
    - For loops

    ### What to do when you get stuck:


    If you get stuck, we recommend to:

    - Ask one of our Python experts for help
    - Search online (here are a couple of useful resources):
        - The answer box on the top of Google's results page
        - [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) (for task specific solutions)
        - [RealPython](https://realpython.com) (for topic based tutorials)
        - [w3schools](https://w3schools.com]) (for short task specific tutorials and examples)
    - Ask your fellow students
